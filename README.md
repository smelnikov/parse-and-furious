# parse-and-furious

A fun collaborative project to build a parser inspired by the [file route
conventions of React
Router](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/file-route-conventions). The parser
splits paths into **segments**, which can be either **static** or **dynamic**.

Constraints and edge cases are covered in the property-based tests using
`fast-check`.
